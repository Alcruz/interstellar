\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
The abstract of the report goes here. The abstract should state the
topic(s) under investigation and the main results or
conclusions. Methods or approaches should be stated if this is
appropriate for the topic. The abstract should be self-contained,
concise and clear. The typical length is one paragraph.

\section{Another section} \label{sec:my1}

\subsection{A subsection} \label{subsec:theory}

Subsections may be used. Use a clear structure in your report.

We denote the set of real numbers by
$\mathbb{R}$, the set of integers by $\ZZ$ and the set of complex
numbers by $\mathbb{C}$. Our analysis is based on the equation
$e^{\pi i} = -1$ and the relation
\begin{equation}
  \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}   \label{eq:myeq1}
\end{equation} % no empty line after this
which we verify in the appendix \ref{app:calculations}.
Useful consequences are
\begin{align}
  \frac{4}{8} &= \frac{1}{2} \\
  \frac{4}{12} + \frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^{\infty} \frac{t^{s-1}}{e^t-1} dt
     &= \frac{1}{3} +\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}\\
  \frac{2}{10} &= \frac{1}{5} 
\end{align}
For any $0\neq a\in \ZZ$, the equality
\begin{equation*} % * for no numbering
 \frac{2 a}{4 a} = \frac{1}{2}
\end{equation*}
follows from equation \eqref{eq:myeq1}.

Sometimes subsubsections may be appropriate.

This could contain a table of interesting numbers
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{r|cccccc}
    $n$   & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \\ \hline
    $F_n$ & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 5 & 8 \\
    $B_n$ & $\tfrac{1}{2}$ & $\tfrac{1}{6}$ & 0 & $-\tfrac{1}{30}$ & 0 &  $\tfrac{1}{42}$ \\
    $p_n$ & 2 & 3& 5& 7 & 11 & 13 \\
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Yet another section} \label{sec:my2}

Graphics can be included. Figure \ref{fig:bsd} shows an example.
Learn about floats and pictures in the \LaTeX\ wikibook to place
the figures at the right place.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

Further help on \LaTeX\ can be found easily on the internet. The \LaTeX\
wikibook\footnote{\tt http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX} contains a lot.
For instance you would find there how to type theorems and proofs nicely.
Or how to include source code written in some programming language like
python. There are long lists available with all sorts of common
mathematical symbols like $\xi$, $\nabla$, $\infty$, $\log$, $\iff$, etc.

\appendix

\section{Raw data} \label{app:rawdata}

Material that needs to be included but would distract from the main
line of presentation can be put in appendices.
Examples of such material are raw
data, computing codes and details of calculations.

But note tha the maximal number of pages includes the appendix and the references.

\section{Calculations for section \ref{sec:my1}} \label{app:calculations}

In this appendix we could verify equation \eqref{eq:myeq1} or present the code that was used. 
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def gcd(a,b):
    """
    Return the greatest common divisor
    of a and b 
    """
    while b > 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
\end{lstlisting}
